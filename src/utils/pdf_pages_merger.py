Found this website which does exactly that:
https://avepdf.com/convert-to-one-page-pdf

Applied it on:
data/ocr_data/da/handwritten/ALEXANDRU-ARSINEL_Declaratie-de-avere.pdf

and obtained:
data/ocr_data/da/handwritten/ALEXANDRU-ARSINEL_Declaratie-de-avere_one_page.pdf

doesn't necessarily does the trick because it merges without eliminating the header and footer space
so, it is not worth doing it
